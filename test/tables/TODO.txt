just use local postgres instance for testing?
    also just do rudimentary sql string checking
        esp if no db connection to localhost

    see notes in phone

verify the Table methods work
    create stubs to verify that these work correctly
    cause one or two sqlalchemy errors for each, like a faulty engine or a the server getting shut down mid work
    catch a pandas error, make sure the method returns none

    use CTran_Data to test Table, but be sure to also get Duplicated_Data.create_table to verify that Table.create_table works normally
        have each other subclass create the table to verify that all of the supplied info is working right, since create_table uses all of the supplied data and the ctran_data tests use the exact same methods as the others

    make sure the engine is built properly?


integration tests
    can actually connect to the db
