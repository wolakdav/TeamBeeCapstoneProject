To create a new flagger:
Copy the boilerplate class, change the class name, the name field, the flag
method, and add the class to the flaggers list. The flag class must return a 
list of flag, or an empty list.


Flags
-----

There are different types of flags used to represent different types of things 
present in a row data (object):


*_NULL flags mean that a particular field is null (e.g.: SERVICE_DATE_NULL 
means service_date field is null):
